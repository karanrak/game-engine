README for HW1 :

To run the program, set the Project Properties> C++> General> Additional Include directories to include the local implementation 
of SFML\include. The required dlls are included.

Next carry out similar task to enter path of SFML\lib in Linker>General to update the additional library directories.

The program should work once these two steps are carried out.

The window controls are listed below:
1 : Left, Right, Up : Directional Motion
2 : 'R' : toggling between scaling and proportional using the event system.
3 : 'T' : toggling between scaling and proportional using real-time inputs (less reliable, check Design Document section 4 for more info).
